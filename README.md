IBM Quantum Challenge Africa 2021
Challenge Dates: 9 September (07:00 UTC) - 20 September (23:00 UTC)
To ensure Africa is able to utilize quantum computing to solve problems relevant to the continent, skills in applying the technology must be developed and the community must grow. This will benefit all of Africa as well as the world. In pursuit of this goal, the IBM Research Lab in South Africa and the University of the Witwatersrand have developed a challenge incorporating problems relevant to Africa in the fields of optimization, finance, and chemistry.

The challenge exercises are developed by African researchers for African learners, researchers, and industry professionals. Participants need not have any formal education in quantum computing, as the challenge focuses on its application to already existing classical problems.

If you want to develop your skills in applying quantum computing to problems using Qiskit and the IBM Quantum platform; register here: http://ibm.co/ibmQuantumAfrica21.
